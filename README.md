# SandboxMirror

SandboxMirror is a tool for reverse engineering Apple's sandbox on Mac
OS X (aka macOS), which is closed-source and almost entirely
undocumented.  Its internal workings are interesting in themselves.
And a better understanding of them should be useful for application
developers on OS X -- for example by making it easier to learn how to
configure the sandbox intelligently.

SandboxMirror runs on OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) through macOS 10.12
(Sierra).
